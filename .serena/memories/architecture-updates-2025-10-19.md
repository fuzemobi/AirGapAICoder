## AirAI CLI Global Installation Enhancement

### Overview
Added one-command global installation for AirAI CLI across all platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux), making it accessible system-wide without manual PATH configuration.

### New Components Added

#### 1. Installation Scripts
- **scripts/installation/install-airai-windows.ps1** (PowerShell)
  - Automated installer for Windows
  - Checks Python 3.9+ with version validation
  - Auto-installs pip if missing
  - Verifies airai command availability
  - Handles PATH refresh for current session
  - Supports wheel-based air-gap installation
  - Beautiful colored terminal output

- **scripts/installation/install-airai.sh** (Bash)
  - Automated installer for macOS/Linux
  - Cross-platform Python version detection (BSD/GNU sed compatible)
  - macOS Homebrew Python support (--break-system-packages flag)
  - Automatic PATH configuration hints
  - Air-gap deployment via WHEEL_PATH environment variable
  - Colored terminal output with status messages

#### 2. Uninstall Scripts
- **scripts/installation/uninstall-airai-windows.ps1** (PowerShell)
- **scripts/installation/uninstall-airai.sh** (Bash)

### Key Features

1. **Platform Detection**
   - Automatically handles OS-specific differences
   - macOS: Uses --break-system-packages for Homebrew Python
   - Linux: Standard pip install
   - Windows: PowerShell with proper error handling

2. **Python Validation**
   - Requires Python 3.9+
   - Clear error messages if version not met
   - Automatic pip bootstrapping via ensurepip

3. **PATH Management**
   - Verifies airai command is accessible after install
   - Provides helpful PATH configuration hints
   - Refreshes environment for current session

4. **Air-Gap Support**
   - Install from wheel files offline
   - Windows: `-WheelPath` parameter
   - Unix: `WHEEL_PATH` environment variable

### Installation Methods

1. **Development Install**: `pip install -e .` from source
2. **Air-Gap Install**: From wheel file with `--no-index`
3. **System Install**: Platform-appropriate flags

### PowerShell Syntax Issues Fixed

**Issue 1 - Line 119: Python command quote nesting**
```powershell
# Before (broken)
$scriptsPath = & $PythonPath -c "import sys, os; print(os.path.join(sys.prefix, 'Scripts'))"

# After (fixed)
$scriptsPath = & $PythonPath -c 'import sys, os; print(os.path.join(sys.prefix, "Scripts"))'
```

**Issue 2 - Lines 144, 146: Nested double quotes**
```powershell
# Before (broken)
Write-Host "  airai chat qwen-32b-cline ""Write a Python function""" -ForegroundColor Cyan

# After (fixed)
Write-Host '  airai chat qwen-32b-cline "Write a Python function"' -ForegroundColor Cyan
```

### Documentation Updates

1. **src/airai/README.md**
   - Added "Quick Install (Recommended)" section at top
   - Documented automated installers for all platforms
   - Added uninstall instructions
   - Added air-gap deployment instructions

2. **README.md**
   - Added "Install AirAI CLI Globally (One Command!)" section
   - Updated Quick Start with installation examples
   - Emphasized one-command installation feature

3. **CHANGELOG.md**
   - Added [Unreleased] section documenting new features
   - Listed all new scripts and capabilities
   - Documented technical details and benefits

### Console Script Entry Point

**pyproject.toml** already had the correct configuration:
```toml
[project.scripts]
airai = "airai.cli:main"
```

This enables global `airai` command after `pip install`.

### Testing

**Verified on:**
- macOS 13 with Python 3.13 and Homebrew ✅
- Installation completes successfully ✅
- `airai` command globally available ✅
- All dependencies installed correctly ✅

**Windows testing:**
- PowerShell syntax errors fixed ✅
- Script parses correctly ✅

### Benefits

1. **Developer Experience**: 30-second setup vs manual configuration
2. **Enterprise Deployment**: Scriptable for IT automation
3. **Offline Support**: Works in air-gapped environments with wheels
4. **Cross-Platform**: Consistent experience on all platforms

### Git Commits

1. `1a07822` - "Add one-command global installation for AirAI CLI on all platforms"
2. `17fefac` - "Fix PowerShell syntax errors in install-airai-windows.ps1"

### Architecture Impact

**No changes to core architecture** - this is an installation enhancement only.

The AirAI CLI itself remains unchanged. We've simply made it easier to install globally on all platforms.

### Deployment Architecture

```
Internet-Connected System
├── Clone repository
├── Run: ./scripts/installation/install-airai.sh (or .ps1 on Windows)
├── Python checks and installs airai globally
└── User can run: airai --version

Air-Gap System
├── Transfer wheel file via USB
├── Run: WHEEL_PATH=path/to/wheel.whl ./install-airai.sh
└── Installs from wheel without internet
```

### Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for later versions:
- Add `pipx` support for isolated virtual environment
- Windows Installer (.msi) for enterprise deployment
- Chocolatey package for Windows
- Homebrew formula for macOS
- APT/RPM packages for Linux distributions

### Important Notes

- **macOS Homebrew**: Requires `--break-system-packages` flag due to PEP 668
- **Windows PATH**: May require terminal restart for `airai` to be available
- **Linux**: Standard pip install, works with system Python or venv
- **Air-Gap**: Build wheel with `python -m build` on internet-connected system

## User Request: Auto-Commit Standards

**User requested:** "Add a standards update to claude to always commit and push changes after making tested code updates."

**Action needed:** Update PROJECT_STANDARDS.md to include auto-commit requirement in Section 4 (Mandatory Workflows).

Suggested addition:
```markdown
### 4.X: Post-Implementation Requirements

After completing implementation and testing:

**You MUST:**
- ✅ Commit changes with descriptive message
- ✅ Push changes to remote repository
- ✅ Include all tested code updates
- ✅ Follow git commit message format (see CLAUDE.md)
```

This ensures all tested changes are immediately version-controlled and backed up.
